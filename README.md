Musica Mobile Application by Yadiel Cabrera
==========

This my version of the musica mobile cross-platform application. This application works on the Android, iOS and Windows phone operating systems. 
This is a project part of the "Ionic 3.0 for Mobile Developers" course on Lynda.com, Sani Yusuf,
the instructor.

The application gets data from an API and displays the information using the
ionic-card component. Also, it allows the user to listen and share the songs by using
Ionic Native.

In order to test out the application's media functionalities it must be run on a
mobile device, not using ionic lab. This is because the Internet browser does not
support the ionic native functionalities.

Here's some screenshots of the application and it's functionalities:
